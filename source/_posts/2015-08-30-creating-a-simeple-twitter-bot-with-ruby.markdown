Let me preface this by saying I'm not always the biggest fan of Twitter bots.  With that said, they can be useful and fun to build.  Here is a quick rundown of creating a simple Twitter bot in Ruby.

First off, you will need to have an existing Twitter account.  Head over to https://dev.twitter.com/ to create a new app that can communicate with Twitter's API.

Ite requires the app's Name, Description, and URL.  Fill out the info.  You can use something like "http://www.example.com" to get started with and update it later.

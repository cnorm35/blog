  <p>
    <p>Programmers are lazy, that is probably one of the greatest things about us.  Anything that takes slightly longer than we think it should “Hmmmmm……I wonder if I could fix that” or “I bet I could make that better&#8221;</p>




<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m the type that can get easily distracted by shiny new things to try out, whether it’s a new framework, gem, pattern, or fancy burbon (I mean, we can’t program all the time)</p>




<p>I started looking into Rails application templates to try to help out these two problems for me.  If I want to try out a new feature, follow along with a tutorial, or just start tinkering with a new project I it takes me a little while to get everything set up to my preferences.  Things like setting up devise, bootstrap, getting flash messages to play nicely with bootstrap and any other confing I think will help with whatever project I’m kicking off.</p>




<p>Why choose a template over just having a full application you can clone from github as a fresh starting point?  Rails templates are a much more powerful and versatile option.  Rails templates are built on Thor which is probably the best feature in Rails you’ve never heard about.  You’re probably pretty familiar with ActiveRecord, ActionController and so on, but Thor is a ruby library for creating command line apps with ruby (link Thor docs and jumpstart tutorial)  Every notice how you don’t have to run bundle install after you create a new rails app?  You have Thor to thank for that.</p>




<p>Adding in the ability to run commands and edit the files is a huge advantage.  It’s also an easy way to stick to best practices with less effort.  How?  You can do things like set up guard, r-spec, and even create a git repo and make an initial commit, all without having to write any code well, except for the template derp.</p>




<p>I’ll admit, I can be pretty sloppy with having tests in my personal apps.  If I’m pressed for time, I’ll normally choose cramming as many features as possible (the F-it Ship it mantra) than tests.  I think this helps combat that having my test suite all set up and ready to go</p>




<p>If you want the TL;DR version, you can create a new rails app from the template by running:</p>




<p>COMMANDS</p>




<p>Or you can see the entire template here: (link Github)</p>




<p><a href="http://ryanswapp.com/posts/How-to-Make-a-Rails-Application-Template">http://ryanswapp.com/posts/How-to-Make-a-Rails-Application-Template</a></p>




<p>Talk about using &lt;&lt;-TEXT, &lt;&lt;-CODE from Thor dsl
When inserting the last line using before (talk about before and after), talk about what the regex is doing and link rubular.</p>




<p>As I was working on this post, I proved my exact point.  Front-end has never been my specialty so I found myself looking up bootstrap elements and past projects to refresh myself. Also, devise flash messages don’t always work well at first with bootstrap.  Luckilty, they know have a page on the devise wiki that helps you add the helper method and get everythi running smoothly.</p>

  <p>
    <p>You may have noticed that my site&rsquo;s name is codebycodes, but I have yet to post any code on here.  Good job on calling me out.  So here it is.  This post will walk you through setting up a new blog with the Octopress blogging framework and deploy to Heroku.  This is the same setup that this blog is currently running on.</p>




<p><p>So first off, what exactly <em>is</em> Octopress.  Octopress is billed as a blogging framework for hackers.  It&rsquo;s a little different that some of the other blogging frameworks you may have had some experience with.</p>

  <p>
    <p><p>On June 20th of this year, I boarded a flight bound for San Francisco.  Armed with only a suitcase and a laptop, I was heading to a coding bootcamp to follow a crazy dream of switching careers and becoming a developer.  I had no idea what the next 3 months would bring.  My first two weeks were spent on the top bunk at a hacker house.  My &ldquo;room&rdquo; was really the living room.  I didn&rsquo;t even have a chance to fall asleep with the light off and not have people working around me until week 3.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/12/03/new-site/">New Site, New Format</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Hello all!  My last post was on a different blog and a few months back. I decided to set up a new blog once I came across the <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blogging framework.  It&rsquo;s billed as &ldquo;A blogging framework for hackers&rdquo; making it much easier to share code snippets.  It&rsquo;s also built in Ruby so it seemed like a great project for me to tinker with.
This will be a place where I can share what I&rsquo;m working on, tips and tricks I pick up, and the occasional rant.</p>




<p><p>So&hellip; on the last update,</p>

    <p><p>I know, I know…having a double negative for my post title isn’t exactly good form.  Maybe it’s a remnant of my southern upbringing, but that’s been a bit of a motto for my stay out here.  I’m not on a vacation, I’m not at a summer camp, it’s a bootcamp.  That was more than apparent this past week.</p>

  <p>
    <p><p>I haven’t been able to keep up with my blog post as much as I would have liked so far, but that’s with good reason.  With week one behind me at Coding Dojo, I’ve put in close to 70 hours of work between writing code, reading code, lectures, debugging, and working on assignments.  That figure would have terrified me before, but what I quickly realized is how much I love diving into these problems and assignments.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/12/03/new-site/">New Site, New Format</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Hello all!  The last time I posted something, it was on a different blog, and a few months back. I decided to set up a new blog once I came across the <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blogging framework.  It&rsquo;s billed as &ldquo;A blogging framework for hackers&rdquo; making it much easier to share code snippets.  It&rsquo;s also built in Ruby so it seemed like a great project for me to tinker with.
This will be a place where I can share what I&rsquo;m working on, tips and tricks I pick up, and the occasional rant.</p>




<p>So&hellip; on the last update, I had just started working on SQL queries at the <a href="http://www.codingdojo.com">Coding Dojo</a> bootcamp.  Shortly after that, we began our PHP section of the bootcamp.  When we finally started working on programming instead of just HTML and CSS, I didn&rsquo;t look back.  The next 2 months or so, I tried to cram as much coding as I could into a day.  That was the main reason I wasn&rsquo;t able to keep up with my posts as much as I would have liked.  I&rsquo;ll going into a lot more detail about the bootcamp experience in a later post.  For now, I just wanted to catch things up.  My 3 months in Silicon Valley we great but I ended up leaving about a week early.  It wasn&rsquo;t for any bad reason though, quite the contrary.  I was leaving early because I got an offer to start working as a Ruby on Rails developer at <a href="http://bestimators.com">Bestimators</a> back in Philadelphia.  The company was about to start a 3 month program with <a href="http://www.dreamitventures.com/">Dreamit Ventures</a>.  Dreamit is one of the top startup accelerators around with offices in New York, Austin, Israel, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.  Leaving the bootcamp a week early meant I had to miss out on presenting a final project at the Coding Dojo&rsquo;s demo day.  Today is the payback.  As I&rsquo;m writing this, the demo day for Dreamit Philly&rsquo;s class of 2014 is in about 3 hours.</p>




<p>Once demo day is wrapped up, and thing have settled down a bit, I&rsquo;ll talk about what it was like going from a coding bootcamp directly into a startup incubator for 3 months.</p>




<p>For now, thank you so much for cheeking out the new blog and please feel free to ask me any questions you might have about switching careers, becoming a software developer, working at an early stage startup, or what it&rsquo;s like to go through a start up accelerator.</p>

  <p>
    <p><p>I know, I know…having a double negative for my post title isn’t exactly good form.  Maybe it’s a remnant of my southern upbringing, but that’s been a bit of a motto for my stay out here.  I’m not on a vacation, I’m not at a summer camp, it’s a bootcamp.  That was more than apparent this past week.</p>

    <p><p>Today, I had a bit of a realization.  It was something that really made me realize how my mindset is changing.  I was plugging along at the dojo, and looked at the clock.  Something I do dozens of times a day.  The difference was what I thought afterwards.  It was around 3:30 or so and normally,</p>

  <p>
    <p><p>I haven’t been able to keep up with my blog post as much as I would have liked so far, but that’s with good reason.  With week one behind me at Coding Dojo, I’ve put in close to 70 hours of work between writing code, reading code, lectures, debugging, and working on assignments.  That figure would have terrified me before, but what I quickly realized is how much I love diving into these problems and assignments.</p>
